# Cool-runners-mod-installer

So i dont know if it requires anything but if then just install nodejs and python thats what i used if it dosent work for you tho this is for the project Cool-tagger Vr it will be a game that allows mods
to make a mod use "cool-tagger init" and run it in cmd prompt and make sure the command prompt is in admin mode run it as admin if you use vs code or smth run the app as admin instead and then run it to export the mod then use
cool-tagger compile <file path or local file path> 

dont touch the main.zip if you dont know how to manual install it i recommend the installer.exe down here

also if you wanna know if the mod is setup right like the config is right use cool-tagger test
it will try and find the config file in our local folder what the cmd prompt is targeting and if you want to target another folder use cd <folder path> with the test it will check if the main file is findable and if the image can be find if it cant it will say it will use the default mod image and thats all


(GAME NOT OUT YET)
